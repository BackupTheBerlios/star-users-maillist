<PRE>Hi,

I have been struggling with my Ufsdump backups for some time now.
Regardless of the blocksize i use I see very little improvement in
speed. I have been looking for a replacement and there are a few
threads out there that claim star is much faster. I have a few file
systems that span multiple LTO tapes. Currently I use ufsdump to span
these large filesystems across multiple takes in a script. I would
like to use star so I have been reading the man page on how to span
tapes and I see &quot;-multivol&quot;. However this seems to be an interactive
only option.

Note that  -multivol  is  an  interactive  option  that
          prevents   star  from  being  used  in  non-interactive
          environments.   If  you  like  to  use  it  in  a  non-
          interactive    environment,   you   need   to   specify
          new-volume-script=script in addition in order to  auto-
          mate the media change procedure.


So my question,can anyone on the list share how I can use star tospan
a large filesystem across multiple tapes?

Thanks
Jimmy
