There was no error message (tried -vv, but not -debug). Some time passed 
since, and I do not have those files anymore. But I found a way to reproduce 
this, or at least something similar. How to do this is slightly complicated, 
and I do not understand it fully myself, so I go right to the results. There 
is a level 0 dump and a level 1 dump, and a file F that changed between the 
dumps. If the level 1 dump is extracted with 'star -xpU', then the file F is 
restored to the state it was when the dump was taken. However, if the two 
dumps are extracted onto each other with 'star -xpU -restore', mysteriously F 
is made a hardlink to some other file, and hence of course is not restored to 
its correct state.

Now, the dumps are taken off from a Linux LVM filesystem snapshot. As you 
know, I already discovered irregularities with those (but could not yet
investigate it further satisfactorily due to time constraints). Would you 
suggest that the above problem is caused by a faulty filesystem snapshot 
implementation, or might this be a problem in star? You may inspect the 
tarfiles if you wish, it's just about 2 MB; I uploaded them to 

<A HREF="http://unix.plastictree.net/tmp/20080309/dump0.tar">http://unix.plastictree.net/tmp/20080309/dump0.tar</A>
<A HREF="http://unix.plastictree.net/tmp/20080309/dump1.tar">http://unix.plastictree.net/tmp/20080309/dump1.tar</A>

The file to look out for is `send-backup-test/supervise/pid'. It is made a 
hardlink to `send-backup-test/log/supervise/pid' upon restore as described 
above.
