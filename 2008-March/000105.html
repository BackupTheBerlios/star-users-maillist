</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem may be that the filesystem does not sync meta data fast enough.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To determine this, I must take a look at the file in question on the snapshot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; which was used for the level 2 dump. I will do so in the next tests.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's technically slightly more complicated than I thought, because I will

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't looked into this yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I discovered further details:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If this is the case, should a `sync' between touching the timestamp and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; creating the snapshot help? (Well, it depends on the sync implementation and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the filesystem, I guess.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A single `sync' is not enough.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems that `sleep x' with a high enough value of x between the timestamp 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the snapshot remedies the problem. The interesting point is the choice 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of x. I was able to show that the problem occurs for x=0.299, but although I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tried very hard, I could *not* provoke the problem with x=0.3. So, 300 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; milliseconds seem to be the magic threshold.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, this verifies that the problem is caused by the implementation of filesystem 
</I>&gt;<i> in the kernel. I would even call it a bug if you may create a snapshot that
</I>&gt;<i> refers to unstable (unreliable) data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On Solaris, creating a snapshot results in write-loking the FS, syncing, 
</I>&gt;<i> creating the snapshot and removing the write-lock. This gives you reliable
</I>&gt;<i> data in the snapshot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would encourage you to send a bug report to the relevent people.
</I>
I haven't done so yet, mostly because this 300ms threshold soon after was 
disproved. At least on a *busy* system, much larger values for x were needed, 
ranging in the order of a second or so. I had to stop these experiments due 
to time constraints soon after that discovery.

But I tried something else, maybe it's interesting:

- Filesystem A is busy, take snapshot S from it.
- Synchronize filesystem B with S using 'rsync -axH --inplace'.
- Remount B read-only.
- Take an incremental dump from B.
- Restore the incremental dump(s) taken this way to a filesystem C.
- Compare the contents of S with C using diffopts=\!ctime,\!lmtime,\!atime.
- Release S.
- Start over after some time.

So, in B we keep a kind of &quot;mirror&quot; of A, which has the advantage that we can 
mount it read-only and that it is not a snapshot. B is not changed between 
iterations; all we do with it is one run of rsync before each dump. (With 
rsync 3.0.0 a patch [1] is suggested for this.)

This procedure revealed no differences between the snapshot and the restored 
filesystem so far.
