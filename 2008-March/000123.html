Here are some figures.

#  |  rsync S --&gt; V  |  rsync S --&gt; B  |  star B  |  star S  |  approx. size | ratio
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0  |             85  |             54  |      33  |      57  |    961640.00k | .67
1  |            600  |            593  |     217  |     349  |   2485870.00k | .58
2  |             10  |             86  |       1&lt; |       1&lt; |        40.00k |  -
3  |            765  |            813  |     297  |     439  |   3328160.00k | .57
4  |              2  |            109  |       1&lt; |       6  |        20.00k |  -
5  |            743  |            770  |     289  |     428  |   3329230.00k | .58

All times given in seconds. The previous to last column gives how much data 
had to be transfered (by star). One row corresponds to one run of each method 
on the same filesystem snapshot S. All filesystems are ext3 on encrypted 
devices. The snapshot S is on a RAID-1, and all other filesystem are on a 
RAID-0. The last column gives the ratio of the methods 'rsync S --&gt; V' and 
'star S' (where it makes sense to compute it).

Note: maybe these figures will change if one of the parameters is changed, 
e.g., no encryption, different filesystem, etc. I have not investigated this, 
since it would require a lot more work.

For runs 0 to 3, the methods were invoked in the order given, from left to 
right. For subsequent runs, the order was kind of reversed: 'star S', then 
'rsync S --&gt; B', then 'star B', finally 'rsync S --&gt; V'. Why this order was 
chosen (and not a full reverse order), is that 'star B' depends on 'star S 
--&gt; B'. This will become clear by an explanation of the methods.


METHODS

The different methods are:

rsync S --&gt; V: the snapshot S is kind of copied into an empty directory, 
making hardlinks to files of a previous such run where appropriate and only 
transfering changed files. This uses rsyncs --link-dest option. This method 
is applicable as a backup system of its own. The complete call that I use is:
   rsync -axH --inplace --link-dest=&quot;$PREVIOUS&quot; &quot;$SOURCE&quot;/ &quot;$DEST&quot;
What is $DEST in this run will become $PREVIOUS in the next run.
This method gives copies that are identical in the sense of
   diffopts=\!ctime,\!lmtime,\!atime,\!nlink 
I've tested this for some time now.

rsync S --&gt; B: the filesystem B is synchronized with S using 'rsync -axH 
--del --inplace'.

star B: an incremental dump is taken of filesystem B, after B it has been 
synchronized with S with the method above.

star S: an incremental dump is taken of the filesystem snapshot S.


RUNS

Run 0 is the initial one, meaning there were no previous copies or dumps on 
the receiving side, in particular meaning that level 0 dumps were done by 
star.

Run 1 was done after the creation of a many small files (using blogbench). 

Run 2 was done after all these files were deleted. Method 'rsync S --&gt; V' is 
much faster than 'rsync S --&gt; B', which can be explained by the fact that the 
second method had to delete a lot of files on B.

Run 3 was again done after the creation of many small files.

Run 4 (now in &quot;reverse&quot; order of the methods) was done after all the small 
files were deleted.

Run 5 was again done after the creation of many small files.


DISCUSSION

Doing 'star S --&gt; B' and then 'star B' is a backup method, but it has a lot 
of ovehead. It was invented for testing only, because I had problems with the 
'star S' method. (Differences after restore; I explained that in the other 
messages. This combined method, however, never gave differences.)

So the real competitors are 'rsync S --&gt; V' and 'star S' (hoping that the 
problems with the latter can be resolved). Clearly, star is faster than 
rsync; the star runs only take about 60% of the time of the rsync runs. The 
big structural difference is that with rsync, one has the backup in a 
filesystem instead of in a single file (or in few files with incremental 
dumps). This can be an advantage if one often has to access particular files 
in the backup. It can also be a disadvantage if one wishes to write the 
backup to some external medium or push it over the network.
