&gt;<i> By the way, I just did some research on the rename-ctime-thing on Linux, and 
</I>&gt;<i> it appears that something similar was noticed back in 2004 already. There are 
</I>&gt;<i> close to no responses to the patches sent in at that time. Someone even wrote 
</I>&gt;<i> that this behavior is okay according to the SuS, but I am not completely sure 
</I>&gt;<i> that he refers to the same thing. The current Linux Bug Tracker does not give 
</I>&gt;<i> any hits for 'ctime rename', so I will file a bug report there now. Let's see 
</I>&gt;<i> what happens.
</I>
I'm getting really close now.

Remember that I wrote last week that I could reproduce this on ext2, ext3, 
xfs, and reiserfs? It turned out that on each of them -save ext3- the problem 
was due to that 'rapid dump' thing. If I insert a sleep 1 after the dump, the 
problem only persists on ext3. Now we also have the explanation why the 
problem disappeared on Solaris after I inserted the sleep 1.

The idea occurred to me after noticing that I could not reproduce the ctime 
problem on xfs.

Hence I filed that as an ext3 bug now on the Linux Bug Tracker.
