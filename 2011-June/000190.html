&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A look in star.h tells that t_name is only NAMSIZ long, which is 100.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems that you are a victim of a C-compiler bug.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is nothing real that would allow you tp call that a buffer overflow as 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is 100% legal in the tar standard to put up to 100 chars into the t_name 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; array.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> String length is 100, so strcpy will try to put 101 chars into 
</I>&gt;<i> the t_name array, since it appends a null character.
</I>
There still is a difference: in star, the usage of the data structures is 
defined by a standard and star does never even touch any byte outside the data 
structures. 

&gt;<i> &gt; In theory I could use strncpy but this would result in a noticable slowdown or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least performance penalty.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is why star carefully fills up the tar header in the right order. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, but the protection mechanism has no way of knowing this.
</I>
This would not be discussed at the expence of GCC if GCC would not create 
incorrect warnings since a long time just because the parser in gcc ist lousy.

GCC gives tons of false warnings about supposed unintialized data.

If you belive these incorrect warnings and change your code, you will cause the 
IRIX compiler to warn about &quot;useless code&quot; and emit things like &quot;warning 
multiple intialization without use of the variable&quot;.

If I like to know whether there is a non-obvious missing intialization, I ask 
&quot;lint&quot; from the Sun C-compiler because it gives less false warnings.

&gt;<i> Overstepping of array bounds often is an indication that 
</I>&gt;<i> something is not working out as intended by the programmer. While 
</I>&gt;<i> this is not the case here, the warning is still justified.
</I>
If you look at code from experienced programmers, there is a bigger chance to 
get overstepping from library functions. A few years ago, I detected a bug in
memcmp() in the Solaris kernel that caused a kernel panic because it stepped 
into an umnapped kernel page.


&gt;<i> &gt; A major problem with recent GCCs is that they under some circumstances ignore 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the C standard. The code fragment:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	(void)write(STDERR_FILENO, &quot;test\n&quot;, 5);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is not expected to create a warning. It however causes a non-avoidable warning 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on revent Linux versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I get:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $ gcc test.c -Wall -fstack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -O2
</I>&gt;<i> test.c:2:6: warning: return type of ???main??? is not ???int???
</I>&gt;<i> test.c: In function ???main???:
</I>&gt;<i> test.c:3:1: warning: ignoring return value of ???write???, declared with attribute warn_unused_result
</I>
So you may now understzand why the reputation for GCC related to warnings is 
bad. You just verified a defintive compiler bug.

You here also see the main problem in gcc:

it ignores even standard methods to give hints. It ignores (void) casts that
in my example tell the compiler: I intentionally ignore the return code at this 
location. And gcc in addition ignores the standard method that is in use since 
30 years: standardized comments like:

/* LINTED */
/* EMPTY */
/* FALLTHRU */
/* ARGSUSED */
....



&gt;<i> &gt; Did you have a specific reason to use special compiler options?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Array bound checking causes a slow down of the code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is a security measure. Roughly 95% of my system is compiled 
</I>&gt;<i> with stack protector and the fortify source feature. For a few 
</I>&gt;<i> exceptions, it has to be switched off, e.g., Glibc needs some 
</I>&gt;<i> special tuning and a few other packages. And for some packages, 
</I>&gt;<i> I have not figured out yet how to pass CFLAGS to the build 
</I>&gt;<i> system. But the vast majority of my packages is compiled with the 
</I>&gt;<i> protection features turned on.
</I>
See the file COMPILE for instructions.


&gt;<i> &gt; There is a trick to make over-picky compilers quiet......
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change strcpy(ptb-&gt;dbuf.t_name, name); to:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	strcpy(ptb-&gt;ndbuf.t_name, name);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and try again.....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it intended as a permanent fix?
</I>
This is seen as a workaround as an intentionally wrong data structure variant 
cannot be seen as a fix.

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW: would you be interested to write automated test cases?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I recently wrote a test case that I currently use for SCCS, but I would like to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write a test suite for star too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A test suite for star would be good. I'm not sure whether I can 
</I>&gt;<i> give valuable contributions since I do not know much of the 
</I>&gt;<i> internals, so I do not know all the corner cases which need to be 
</I>&gt;<i> tested.
</I>
Well, I wrote test code for star during the past 30 years and I would call star 
the most mature tar implementation, but I did not keep the test code as it was 
never written in a way that allowed to be run automatically.

We need a larger test suite and writing such a test suite may take a long time..
