<PRE>It appears as if star in certain, rare cases does not correctly set the mtime 
upon restore. Incremental backups are made from a filesystem snapshot (using 
LVM under Linux and star 1.5a83) with the following command:

   star -c -xdev -acl -link-dirs \
   -wtardumps dumpdate=stamp \
   fs-name=/fs/data/mount \
   level=&quot;${level?}&quot; \
   f=tarfile.tar \
   -C /root/mnt/snap .

Then, an incremental restore is done into an extra directory (not an empty 
filesystem as I have none available right now). The final snapshot and the 
completely restored filesystem are compared using

   star -c -diff -vv -dump diffopts=\!atime,\!lmtime,\!ctime \
   -C mnt/snap . mnt/backup/restore

The following comes up as expected:

   Only on disk './': 'star-symtable'
   Only on disk './': 'star-tmpdir'
   ./: different nlink,mtime,dir
         0 drwxr-xr-x  10 root/root Aug  9 16:48 2007 ./
         0 drwxr-xr-x   9 root/root Aug 26 13:15 2007 ./

Several such tests were made, and until now these were the only differences 
found. However, recently and surprisingly, there was one other difference:

   home/snyder/sub/25/: different mtime
         0 drwxr-x--x  10 x25_sny/x25_sny Aug 24 23:19 2007 home/snyder/sub/25/
         0 drwxr-x--x  10 x25_sny/x25_sny Aug 26 13:15 2007 home/snyder/sub/25/

The earlier date (Aug 24) is the one from the snapshot. The later date (Aug 26) 
is the restored one, which is wrong. The whole filesystem has almost 600.000 
files or directories across approx. 16 G, and this is the only place where a 
difference occurred.  What could be the reason for this? The restore was *not* 
done on an empty filesystem but into a directory. Could this be the reason?

Another possibility: this directory contained an SSHFS-mountpoint. But it also 
contained a subdirectory which in turn contained an SSHFS-mountpoint, and this 
directory showed no anomalies.

I'd like to do more tests to examine this, but do not really know how.


Regards, Lasse
