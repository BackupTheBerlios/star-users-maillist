</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restore, the old version (from 18:11) was not updated.

</I> 
To determine this, I must take a look at the file in question on the snapshot 
which was used for the level 2 dump. I will do so in the next tests.

If this is the case, should a `sync' between touching the timestamp and 
creating the snapshot help? (Well, it depends on the sync implementation and 
the filesystem, I guess.)

 
&gt;<i> &gt; This looks like typical behavior when the timestamp (later given to star with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; `dumpdate=') is made *after* the snapshot is created. But that's not how I do 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it. Maybe it has to do with accuracy? The times in /etc/tardumps seem to only 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have the accuracy of one second. Then, `sleep 1' between timestamp and snapshot 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should help. I am doing more tests; results are still to be expected.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The timestamp on /etc/tardumps is using a one microsecond granularity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If your filesystem does not give a granularity better than one second, this is a
</I>&gt;<i> problem of the filesystem.
</I>
The entries here look all like this:

root              13 1190157291.000000 Wed Sep 19 01:14:51 2007

It's always zeros after the period. I tried on Solaris, and there the time 
looks like: 1190194893.331676

Hence this seems to be Linux- (specifically ext3-)related.
